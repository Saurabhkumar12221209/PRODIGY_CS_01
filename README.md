 Python 3 Network Packet Sniffer
Python Version OS CodeFactor Grade License

Reddit Discord Twitter

A Network Packet Sniffer developed in Python 3. Packets are disassembled as they arrive at a given network interface controller and their information is displayed on the screen.

This application depends exclusively on the NETProtocols library (also developed and maintained by EONRaider) from version 2.0.0 and above and can be run by any Python 3.8+ interpreter.

Running the Application
I. Development Mode
Simply clone this repository with git clone, install the dependencies and execute the sniffer.py file.

user@host:~$ git clone https://github.com/EONRaider/Packet-Sniffer.git
user@host:~$ cd Packet-Sniffer
user@host:~/packet-sniffer$ pip install -r requirements.txt <--or--> poetry install
user@host:~/packet-sniffer$ sudo python3 packet_sniffer/sniffer.py
The sudo command is required due to the use of socket.SOCK_RAW, which needs administrative privileges to run on GNU/Linux. Notice that the existence of dependencies may require the execution of the interpreter contained in the virtual environment in which the dependencies have been installed (if you use one), instead of just using the system interpreter.

II. (Optional) Build the binary
Use the build.py file to compile your own binary with the PyInstaller package. You just need to install all dependencies and build. Dependency management works with both Poetry (recommended) and Virtualenv.

<-- Install dependencies as shown above in Step I -->
user@host:~/packet-sniffer$ python3 build.py
Usage
sniffer.py [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-d]

Network Packet Sniffer

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        Interface from which packets will be captured (monitors
                        all available interfaces by default).
  -d, --data            Output packet data during capture.
